# Weather-Dashboard
This is a weather dashboard that compiles information from many different major cities all around the world. Simply enter the name of the city you are interested in and you will be able to access the five-day forecast for that location. Each day is represented by an icon, providing an easy-to-understand visual representation of the upcoming weather. You can even add new cities to the list on the side, allowing you to keep track of multiple locations at once. To create this program, I used JQuery, Bootstrap, and two separate APIs.
